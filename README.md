![OmenMon graphical mode overview](https://omenmon.github.io/pic/gui-overview.png)

**OmenMon** is a lightweight application that interacts with the Embedded Controller (EC) and WMI BIOS routines of an _HP Omen_ laptop in order to access hardware settings, in particular to [query temperature sensors](https://omenmon.github.io/gui#temperature) and dynamically [adjust fan speeds](https://omenmon.github.io/gui#fan-control). It also helps you pick your favorite [keyboard backlight colors](https://omenmon.github.io/gui#keyboard) and put the [_Omen_ key](https://omenmon.github.io/config#key) to better use.

**OmenMon** endeavors to replace all the useful functionality of the _Omen Hub_ (a.k.a. _Omen Control Center_), the laptop manufacturer's application, without any of its numerous anti-features. It does not connect to the network at all, does not have advertising, built-in store, social-media integration and whatnot. It does only what you expect it to do and nothing else.

**OmenMon** is designed to run with minimal resource overhead. It comes with a clear and compact [graphical interface](https://omenmon.github.io/gui), offering a great degree of [configurability](https://omenmon.github.io/config) while also featuring an extensive [command-line mode](https://omenmon.github.io/cli) where various BIOS and EC read and write operations can be performed manually. 

Most features are specific to _HP_ devices with a compatible BIOS interface exposed by the `ACPI\PNP0C14` driver but command-line [Embedded Controller operations](https://omenmon.github.io/cli#ec) should work on all laptops.
